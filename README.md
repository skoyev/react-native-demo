# React Native Demo By Sergiy Koyev
React Native Demo App shows the basic and powerfull futures: auth, query and push messaging with the React Native Framework. It allows to build very fast native applications in no time. Setup your project by following the simple steps below.

## How to use it

1. Install the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) package manager with `npm install -g yarn` if you like
2. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Baqend/react-redux-starter`
4. Install the project with `npm install` or `yarn install`
5. Start your app with `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`
6. An Emulator with a sample application should show up

Your app is currently connected to a Baqend test instance called 'app-starter', which provides common backend features like data and file storage, user authentication (used in the example), queries and push notifications among others.
